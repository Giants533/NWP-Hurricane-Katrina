## Abstract

The weather research and forecasting (WRF) is a numerical weather prediction (NWP) system
designed to serve both atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs. In this
project, the results of simulating the Katrina Hurricane event with real data are shown. Different
options for parametrizing the problem and for doing multiple domain simulations are
discussed and compared. We use 5 meteorological magnitudes to study the hurricane: Potential
temperature, pressure and wind’s direction, modulus and vorticity. The veracity of the results
of the simulation is checked comparing in a qualitative way the real trajectory of the hurricane
with the predicted ones. The time evolution of the previously named magnitudes is represented
in gif format, where we appreciate that both the predicted and the real trajectories are
very similar.

This work, both the report in pdf format and the scripts, are for an INDIVIDUAL delivery from the Master's in Modelling for Science and Engineering from the UAB, 2017/2018. So they must not be copied by students from the Master's that are not the authors of this repository.
Anyway, we declare that all the work has been done by the authors of this repository. We remark that the technical stuff has been made mainly by following the tutorial from reference [2].
